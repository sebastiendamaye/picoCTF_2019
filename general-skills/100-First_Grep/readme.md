# First Grep
## Question
>Can you find the flag in [file](files/file)? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way. You can also find the file in `/problems/first-grep_6_c2319e8af66fa6bec197edc733dd52dd` on the shell server.

## Hint
>grep [tutorial](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php)

# Solution
~~~~
$ grep pico file 
picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_cdb327ab}
~~~~

# Flag
`picoCTF{grep_is_good_to_find_things_cdb327ab}`
