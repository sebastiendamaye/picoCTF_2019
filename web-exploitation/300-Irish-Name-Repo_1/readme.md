## Question
>There is a website running at `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21877/` ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21877/)) or `http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:21877`. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

## Hint
>There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this, I wonder if the users are kept in a database?

>Try to think about how does the website verify your login?

# Solution
I don't think this challenge is worth 300 points :)

Connect to the website and go to the [authentication page](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/21877/login.html).

Inject the following content to both the `username` and `password` fields: `' or '1'='1` and voila!

Your flag is: picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_6b96db35}

# Flag
`picoCTF{s0m3_SQL_6b96db35}`
