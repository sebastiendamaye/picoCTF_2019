# where are the robots
## Question
>Can you find the robots? `https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/` ([link](https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/)) or `http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:4159`

## Hint
>What part of the website could tell you where the creator doesn't want you to look?

# Solution
Let's see if the website hosts a `robots.txt` file:
~~~~
$ curl -s https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/robots.txt
User-agent: *
Disallow: /a44f7.html
~~~~

Bad idea to hide parts of the website using this technique. Now, let's extract the flag from this *hidden* page:
~~~~
$ curl -s https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/a44f7.html | grep -o "picoCTF{.*}"
picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_a44f7}
~~~~

# Flag
`picoCTF{ca1cu1at1ng_Mach1n3s_a44f7}`
